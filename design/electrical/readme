Note:

This project has originally been designed with non-free proprietary software.
This is against the principle of LibreCube, where we promote the use of free
and open source tools for all our projects and activities.

Therefore the source files have not been included in this repository. If you
have the spare time and interest, feel free to re-engineer design files from
the drawings, using KiCAD.
